# Ch2_ForwardKinematics

## Problem Statement

Finding the forward kinematic solution of a 2-link planar manipulator. Use the found soluton to wriate a phyton code and simulate in CoppeliaSim.

## Pre-requisites:

- Software: CoppeliaSim (for simulation), Spyder (for Python coding)
- Basic Python syntax
- Understanding of the python remote API commands for CoppeliaSim

## Solution

![2 link planar manipulator](https://github.com/ClemsonFall2021ME8930IntroRobotics-HRI/Ch2_ForwardKinematics/blob/main/Figure%202.15%20-%20Simulation%20-%20DH%20Examples-09.png)

Assume the link lengths to be l1 and l2, respectivley, with coresponding joint angles of &alpha; and &beta;.

To find the manipulator's forward knematic, we ned to find the end effectors position: x2, y2.

First, we should find the positioning of the second joint:
x<sub>1</sub> = l<sub>1</sub>\*cos(&alpha;)
